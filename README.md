Homework 1

In this exercise, we created two simple linear regression models (one with only one feature and the other with two predictive features). The latter model performs better because it has lower mean squared error (MSE), r-squared, and mean absolute error (MAE) scores. Adding additional features to a model does not always equal a better model, but in our case, we added a feature that fits the model well. Hence of the better fit overall and a better predictive model.
